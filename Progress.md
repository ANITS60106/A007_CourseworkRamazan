Week_003
My final idea is not just a loan aggregator like Banki.ru or Nova Bank, but a personal financial navigator that helps people not only choose a product, but also understand what is realistically available to them and what financial path is safe.

In existing solutions, users see a list of banks and interest rates, but they do not understand where they are actually likely to get approved. As a result, they submit multiple applications, receive rejections, waste time, and damage their credit history. I change the entire logic: first, the system evaluates the user’s situation, and only then offers suitable financial solutions. In this way, the platform answers not the question “where is it cheaper,” but “what can I get right now and why.”

The platform brings together banks and microfinance organizations, but it works not as a showcase, but as a filter. The user fills out a short questionnaire and then receives a personalized picture: which products fit them with a high probability, where rejection is possible, and what steps they should take to improve their chances in the future. If a loan is not доступible at the moment, the system suggests alternatives — installment plans, a smaller amount, microfinancing, or a preparation plan for future credit. This way, even a rejection becomes not a dead end, but a clear next step.

The key difference from existing services is the preliminary approval probability assessment and the reduction of unnecessary rejections. Banks and MFIs receive not random applications, but already “prepared” clients, which reduces the workload on call centers and increases conversion rates. Users, in turn, save time and gain transparent understanding of their financial possibilities.

A special focus is placed on the conditions of Kyrgyzstan. The platform takes into account weak internet access in rural regions and provides basic offline access through SMS or USSD for checking application status and receiving offers. All information is presented in simple language, including support for the Kyrgyz language, with clear explanations of real overpayment and risks, so that the product is understandable even for people without a financial background.

Thus, the project solves several problems at once: it improves financial accessibility, reduces the number of unjustified rejections, helps people make more informed decisions, and creates value for banks through higher-quality leads. This makes the product not a copy of existing aggregators, but an infrastructure-level fintech solution that can scale within the country and to other markets with similar challenges.
